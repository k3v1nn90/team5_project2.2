#Howdy, My name is Kevin Ngo!

I am Technology Management major and in the class of 2022. I am working on getting a minor Business and Cybersecurity. I have two brothers and two sisters, which are all younger than me. I am a first generation college student and Aggie. The reason I chose this major is because I like to help and lead people/organization to success. I plan to work for a big organization's IT specialists and move my way up in the business after college. I was born and raised in Houston, TX and plan to return there or work somewhere around this area. I almost forgot to say that I am a first generation American. My father and mother legally immirgrated from Vietnam to America. I have some understanding in Vietnamese and Spanish. I like to cook and play video games.
